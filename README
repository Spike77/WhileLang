this project is about programming a command-line interpreter for the 
abstract programming language "While" as specified in the textbook 
"Semantics with Applications" by Nielson&Nielson.

It aims to implement a command-line-interpreter to work with Staments
of While, returning correct error-messages, reading code from txt-Files
and finally, translating While-code into Java-, C- and C++-Code.

It is intended to accomplish the translation by converting the input into
a syntax-tree. The Project-Language is Java.

As the dear Reader might see, its rather a educational project, than a 
professional one.
